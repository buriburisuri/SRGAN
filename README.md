# SRGAN(Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network
A tensorflow implementation of Christian et al's "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" paper. 
( See : [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) ) 
This implementation is quite different from original paper.  The differences are as followings:

1. MNIST data set is used for convenience. ( It'll be straight-forward applying this scheme to large image data set like Urban 100 )  
1. I've completely replace MSE loss with GAN using tuple input for discriminator.( see training source code )
1. I've used ESPCN ( sub-pixel CNN ) instead of deconvolution. ( see : [ http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Shi_Real-Time_Single_Image_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf]( http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Shi_Real-Time_Single_Image_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) )

The existing CNN based super-resolution skill mainly use MSE loss and this makes super-resolved images look blurry. 
If we replace MSE loss with gradients from GAN, we may prevent the blurry artifacts of the super-resolved images 
and this is the key idea of this paper. I think this idea looks promising and my experiment result using MNIST data set looks good.        

## Dependencies

1. tensorflow >= rc0.11 
1. [sugartensor](https://github.com/buriburisuri/sugartensor) >= 0.0.1.7

## Training the network

Execute
<pre><code>
python train.py
</code></pre>
to train the network. You can see the result ckpt files and log files in the 'asset/train' directory.
Launch tensorboard --logdir asset/train/log to monitor training process.


## Generating image
 
Execute
<pre><code>
python generate.py
</code></pre>
to generate sample image.  The 'sample.png' file will be generated in the 'asset/train' directory.
